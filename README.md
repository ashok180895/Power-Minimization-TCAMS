# Power-Minimization-TCAMS

This project is about power minimization technique in TCAMS using ruleset nature. The unique values in each field were calculated and the fields are rearranged based on uniqueness like high to low. For simulations static packet generator is used for packet generation and classbench rule sets(Firewall, ACL, IPC ) of different sizes in rule counts are used. For each rule set , a modified field order is given which shows better performance. A high of 57% is given with our new approach
